    <h1>NATURE</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <P>The natural world is an incredible wonder that inspires us all. It underpins our economy, our society, 
       indeed our very existence. Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, 
       the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, 
       happiness and prosperity. </P>

        <h1>KENYA ARTS</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <P>The culture of Kenya is divers. There are more than 40 tribes each with their own traditions and customs.
           Throughout the 20th century, the Kenyan culture has had western influences and this is evident in modern Kenya. 
           However, the Kenyan culture, which has evolved over the centuries, is rich and very much alive. 
           It can be seen in the visual arts, applied arts, Kenya food, music, dance, sports, fashion, literature, theatre and the Kenya people. </P>
